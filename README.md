# KNN Plinko Game

This is the browser version of the popular Plinko game as seen on The Price is Right

## Built With

* HTML5 Canvas
* Javascript
* K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
* Lodash

## How I built it
This app was bootstrapped from the [machine-learning-with-javascript](https://www.udemy.com/machine-learning-with-javascript/) course on Udemy. The portion I contributed was the KNN algorithm using primarily Lodash functions.

## Challenges I ran into
Before getting started with code, I had to learn Machine Learning terminology and had to distinguish which pieces of data corresponded to the features and labels of the problem. That way, I could get started with filtering and testing my data with a test set. Finding an optimal value for K and including which of features to use also proved to be tricky because the prediction percentage ranged from 10-30%, slightly better than random.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This was my first dive into an ML algorithm, it doesn't use abstract functions from separate libraries or frameworks but I was able to practice the fundamental concepts.

## What I learned
Before starting my deep dive into ML, I was able to get a feel for the fundamentals as well as understand what data is relevant to solving a problem. I got a better understanding of how to differentiate between a classification and regression problem.


## What's next for Plinko
I'd like to get my prediction percentage closer to 50 % but that might be difficult because I don't want to change the fundamental way the game works by altering the ball bounciness.
